ABOUT_PROJECT:-
-> This project is all about housing price prediction where a dataset called "california housing" is given and goal is to predict the price of the houses.

FLOW_OF_PROJECT:-

1) starts with fetching data from dataset.

2) Data analysis using pandas dataframe.

3)Creating Training and Testing set.

4) Plotting graphs between features to gain insights using matplotlib and checking for correlations.

5) Preparing the data for machine learning algorithms
   ->strtafying the samples
   ->Data Cleaning
   ->Handling categorial variables using one hot encoding
   ->Creating custom transformers (Creating own functions)
   ->Standardizing the data.
Created a pipeline using scikit-learn which does all the functions.

6)Select models for training and choosing best one
  -> Started with linear regression and performed worse
  -> Then used Decision trees,performed even worse because model was overfit. I used cross validation technique to check whether model gone over fitting or not.
  -> Then used Random forests which uses ensemble learning and performed better than other models.
  -> Used Grid search technique to tune models with different hyperparameters.
  -> For different set of hyperparmeters,ill get different models which i trained them seperately and evaluated using cross validation.

7)Discovering feature importances by checking weights of features of models.

8)Now finally evaluating the best model on testing set.

METRIC I USED TO EVALUATE MODEL IS RMSE.
