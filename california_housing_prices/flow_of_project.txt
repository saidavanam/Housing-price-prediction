Steps :-


Upstream components:-
1)Frame the problem (regression or classification)
2)select performance measure
3)check out the requirements
4)Get the data
5)Download the data
6)create the workspace :- programming language,modules,environments.
7)Load the data and take a look at it
8)Data analysis
9)splitting the data
10)gaining insights from the data
->plotting various features
->expermimenting with different combinations
11)Preparing the data for machine learning algorithms
->data cleaning
->Handling text and categorical attributes using one hot encoding
->feature scaling
Create Pipelines for data preprocessing(do seperately for numerical and categorical and combine using FeatureUnion class)
12)Select and Train the model
13)Fine tune model using grid search and randomized search
14)analyse best model and errors

Downstream components:-
1)Evaluate your system on test set
2)make presentations and documents for insights
3)launch,monitor and maintain the system
